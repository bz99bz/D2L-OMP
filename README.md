# Diffusing on Two Levels and Optimizing for Multiple Properties: A Novel Approach to Generating Molecules with Desirable Properties

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for our paper **"Diffusing on Two Levels and Optimizing for Multiple Properties: A Novel Approach to Generating Molecules with Desirable Properties"**. 

## Current Status

We are currently in the process of cleaning and organizing the code and datasets used in our study. This is to ensure that the materials are user-friendly and can be easily reproduced by other researchers.

## Upcoming Release

We will be releasing:
- The complete source code for the D2L-OMP model.
- The datasets used in our experiments, including QM9 and ZINC250K.
- Detailed setup instructions and guidelines for reproducing the results from our paper.

## Timeline

We anticipate that the code and datasets will be available within the next few weeks. Please stay tuned for updates.
